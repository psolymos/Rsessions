# Issues to cover

* Weirdest ever GIS output: "1,234,567.0058654"
* Mixed case stuff: "W-123" vs. "w-123"
* Leading/trailing whitespace: "W-123" vs. "W-123 "
* How to find mismatch (compare_sets)
* memory size comparisons (factor vs character)
* conversion: integer, numeric, factor, character types.
* Excel turning values into dates (e.g. 0-3 OK, but 3-5 is 05-Mar)
